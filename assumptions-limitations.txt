Assumptions
1. I did not fully understand what the question meant by 'the time for when it was checked', so I used the current time.



Extending my solution:
1. I used job_name(a column in the jobs table) as the unique identifier. A better identifier would be an id/build_id
2. To further increase code reusabilty, the code could split into classes (DB class, Jenkins API class etc)
